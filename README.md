## beerApp-react
This is one of the many projects I took up to fine tune my skill in frontend developement, It was a screenshot of a project completed by someone in a forum, I found it intresting so I took it up. Initially I used vanilla javascript(it is also in my repo) but this is the react version

## demo
run the demo here https://theophilly.github.io/beerApp-react/

## limitations
This project is just a practice project on the frontend, hence there is no backend or much fancy stuff
